# ThePowerOfParallel

You probably already knew about the parallel versions of for and foreach. But how much faster is it? Why donâ€™t you experiment with it yourself with this simple console app.

My hope with this simple code example is that more developers dare to use the true power of .NET.

Please note that the normal List is not suitable for parallel operations, you should probably stick with the safer concurrentbag.

Happy coding!
